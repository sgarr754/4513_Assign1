Two are shown with African mask-like faces and three more with faces in the Iberian style of Picasso's native Spain, giving them a savage aura.

The artist worked on the painting in several campaigns, beginning in 1884 with a layer of small horizontal brushstrokes of complementary colors. He later added small dots, also in complementary colors, that appear as solid and luminous forms when seen from a distance.Seurat's use of this highly systematic and ""scientific"" technique, subsequently called Pointillism, distinguished his art from the more intuitive approach to painting used by the Impressionists. Although Seurat embraced the subject matter of modern life preferred by artists such as Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, he went beyond their concern for capturing the accidental and instantaneous qualities of light in nature. Seurat sought to evoke permanence by recalling the art of the past, especially Egyptian and Greek sculpture and even Italian Renaissance frescoes. As he explained to the French poet Gustave Kahn, ""The Panathenaeans of Phidias formed a procession. I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color."" Some contemporary critics, however, found his figures to be less a nod to earlier art history than a commentary on the posturing and artificiality of modern Parisian society.Seurat made the final changes to La Grande Jatte in 1889.

Using vivid, apparently arbitrary, colours, Matisse has captured the sensation of sunlight striking the sitter's face and casting a heavy shadow down one side. He has also tried to create a dynamic but balanced relationship between complementary colours, such as blue and orange, red and green. Complementary colours 'complete' each other: they are at their most intense when placed together. Matisse adjusted his colours to obtain the maximum intensity. This non-naturalistic use of colour can be seen as a radical development of certain aspects of Impressionist art, and it led the critics to dub Matisse a 'fauve' (wild beast).","Using vivid, apparently arbitrary, colours, Matisse has captured the sensation of sunlight striking the sitter's face and casting a heavy shadow down one side.",1905,39,29,Oil on canvas,523,700,,,,"{""safeSearchAnnotation"":{""violence"":1,""racy"":1},""dominantColors"":[{""color"":{""red"":135,""green"":151,""blue"":185},""web"":""#8797B9"",""name"":""Rock Blue""},{""color"":{""red"":199,""green"":147,""blue"":124},""web"":""#c7937c"",""name"":""Feldspar ""},{""color"":{""red"":209,""green"":188,""blue"":159},""web"":""#D1BC9F"",""name"":""Soft Amber""},{""color"":{""red"":137,""green"":62,""blue"":81},""web"":""#893E51"",""name"":""Camelot""},{""color"":{""red"":102,""green"":125,""blue"":176},""web"":""#667DB0"",""name"":""Chetwode Blue""},{""color"":{""red"":109,""green"":151,""blue"":144},""web"":""#6d9790"",""name"":""Gumbo""}]}"

It depicts a couple embracing, their bodies largely hidden by elaborate robes decorated in a style that bears little relation to any historical textile designs. As well as conventional oil paint, gold leaf has been used, one of the aspects of the work that gives it a strikingly modern appearance, while evoking memories of much earlier art.

The Ministry bought it from there for the sum of 25,000 Kronen and thus secured for the state one of the icons of Viennese Jugendstil and indeed of European modern art. It undoubtedly represents the culmination of the phase known as the ‘«£Golden Epoch‘«ÿ. In this decade, the artist created a puzzling, ornamental encoded programme that revolved around the mystery of existence, love and fulfilment through art. Klimt gained initial inspiration for this in 1903 on a journey to Ravenna to see the Byzantine mosaics. In addition, the painting contains a myriad of motifs from various cultural epochs, above all from Ancient Egyptian mythology. Most recent research has, however, revealed that it is not enough to read the ornaments in the picture just as symbols rooted in tradition aiming to convey a timelessly valid message.

The work's complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. The painting shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velazquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velazquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velazquez is shown working on.","The work's complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted.

The Spanish general, the Genoese aristocrat Ambrogio Spinola, conquered Breda in contradiction to the instructions of his superiors.

Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velazquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velazquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.","Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid.

The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern. The tied-up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l'oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a cittern, a member of the lute/guitar family). The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; luit was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.","The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern.

The girls are shown posing statically against a very roughly indicated, generalised background, with just a hint of a decorative landscape. Dressed and coiffed a la mode, they look like true grown up ladies, the eldest holding herself importantly and with a sense of her own importance, just like a lady at court. The youngest gently holds her sister by the shoulder, frozen in the pose in which she has been stood by the artist. The official majesty of the formal portrait is softened by the little dog, surprised by his mistresses' immobility, who scratches wonderingly at the eldest girl's dress with one paw.

This work captures his recollections of Tahiti and his romantic dreams of the harmony of all on earth. The Tahitian girls symbolise different stages in life. The young islander with the halo above her head, deep in sleep, is the embodiment of virgin purity, while the second girl with the fruit in her hand, ready to take a bite, is like Eve. In the depths of the landscape islanders are dancing around an idol, some mysterious ancient god.

The Hermitage work is one of the first of his paintings to show the haystack, which was to be the subject of whole series of works. Monet in virtuoso style captures the fine nuances of effects of light and air, picking the very moment at which the weather is changing and the horizon brightening on an overcast, windy day. The Impressionists painted such overcast weather with bright, light colours, which enabled them to capture the translucent sky and bring out the endlessly rich nuances of colour.","The Hermitage work is one of the first of his paintings to show the haystack, which was to be the subject of whole series of works.",1886,81,60,Oil on canvas,700,900,,,,"{""safeSearchAnnotation"":{""violence"":1,""racy"":1},""dominantColors"":[{""color"":{""red"":200,""green"":189,""blue"":188},""web"":""#C8BDBC"",""name"":""Silver""},{""color"":{""red"":169,""green"":155,""blue"":97},""web"":""#A99B61"",""name"":""Barley Corn""},{""color"":{""red"":103,""green"":124,""blue"":82},""web"":""#677C52"",""name"":""Willow Grove""},{""color"":{""red"":42,""green"":55,""blue"":54},""web"":""#2A3736"",""name"":""Aztec""},{""color"":{""red"":189,""green"":139,""blue"":92},""web"":""#bd8b5c"",""name"":""Twine""},{""color"":{""red"":208,""green"":131,""blue"":88},""web"":""#d08358"",""name"":""Burning Sand""}]}"

Thus there was a demand that the contours in painting be dear and sometimes even sharp. Bronzino's works are considered the epitome of Florentine disegno and, at the same time, its final pinnacle, which had already assumed the character of Mannerism. Bronzino, who was a pupil of Jacopo Pontormo and thus extremely familiar with the works of Michelangelo, served for many years as court painter to the Medici. He created decorations (now lost) for numerous theatrical works and festive occasions and supplied brilliant designs for the Medici tapestry factory. In his composition Bronzino organises the group in close proximity to one another in the foreground. Nevertheless the figures are arranged next to and behind each other in a way that makes them easy to recognise. The infant St. John is in the foremost position, his gaze and gesture pointing to the infant Jesus, who is depicted frontally. Behind them stands St. Mary, who is holding her son's arm in a loving gesture. The composition is extended by St. Anne and St. Joseph, who stand out from the central group of three because of their more natural skin colour. More than in almost any other of his works, Bronzino has emphasised the sharply outlined and sculptural figures almost to the point of stony coldness, especially in the case of the two boys. This artistic decision is also an example of paragone (Italian: comparison) - the competition, discussed in art theory at the time, between painting and sculpture to see which could create the better depiction of three-dimensional forms. Here Bronzino creates exciting contrasts: the coolness and clarity of his composition as opposed to the intimate familiar atmosphere; soft and gentle movements contrasted with formal severity and abstraction; turning away from natural models on the one hand but depicting all of their details on the other.","Completely in contrast to the principles of Venetian painting, which made colour the dominant means of expression, Renaissance painting in Florence gave priority to the drawing as the means of expressing artistic invention.",1545,101,126,Oil on wood,900,1200,https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/holy-family-with-st-anne-and-the-infant-st-john/kQF72Dy8lZiemg?hl=en,,,"{""safeSearchAnnotation"":{""violence"":1,""racy"":3},""dominantColors"":[{""color"":{""red"":73,""green"":61,""blue"":45},""web"":""#493d2d"",""name"":""Deep Bronze""},{""color"":{""red"":193,""green"":175,""blue"":163},""web"":""#c1afa3"",""name"":""Silk""},{""color"":{""red"":20,""green"":33,""blue"":32},""web"":""#142120"",""name"":""Swamp""},{""color"":{""red"":84,""green"":32,""blue"":23},""web"":""#542017"",""name"":""Caput Mortuum""},{""color"":{""red"":44,""green"":51,""blue"":92},""web"":""#2c335c"",""name"":""Lucky Point""},{""color"":{""red"":177,""green"":113,""blue"":96},""web"":""#b17160"",""name"":""Coral Tree""}]}"

The Castello Alfonso, on a small island nearby, deeply impressed him during his stay. When the young, widowed Marie Berna visited Bocklin's studio in Florence in 1880 and asked for a 'picture to dream by,' the memory of that landscape must have merged with earlier memories of, for example, the islands of the dead like San Michele in Venice and Etruscan cliff-necropolises. The Isle of the Dead became one of Bocklin's most popular pictorial works. He achieved this by combining a limited number of ideas into an impressive atmospheric composition. The motifs - island, water, and castle or villa by the sea - are already familiar from many of his earlier works. However, in this case they have been concentrated into a statement of the artist's Weltanschauung. The location is sinister. The viewer's gaze is led up the steps but can penetrate no further into the darkness. The island's strict symmetry, the calm horizontals and verticals, the circular island surrounded by high cliff walls, and the magical lighting create an atmosphere that is both solemn and sublime, evoking a sense of stillness and other-worldliness. The ripple-less surface of the water and the boat bearing the coffin with a figure shrouded in white behind it add a melancholy tone to the whole.", The Isle of the Dead became one of Bocklin's most popular pictorial works.

Boucher's success in communicating the charm and sensuality of the nude lies in his mastery of color and fluid brushstrokes. Venus is rendered in porcelain tones, delicately accented in pink, her body highlighted against luscious blue velvet and silk. The two white doves at her feet contrast a thick impasto surface with the transparent water and cool greens and blues of the foliage.
